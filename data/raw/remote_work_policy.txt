🚘 1. Expected Price in India (2026)

BMW M8 Competition is sold as a premium luxury performance car in India. Its on-road price varies significantly by city due to local tax & registration structures:

📊 On-Road Price Estimates (varies by city)

₹2.65 – ₹2.74 Crore — cities like Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Delhi/NCR area

₹2.80 – ₹2.93 Crore — in cities like Hyderabad, Pune, Bangalore

Up to ₹3.02 Crore — in Kochi and other higher tax jurisdictions

➡️ Ex-showroom price (before registration, insurance, TCS, GST etc.) is generally ~₹2.38 Crore for the M8 Competition coupe.

Notes:

“On-road price” includes RTO registration, insurance, statutory fees, and Tax Collected at Source (TCS).

Prices may vary slightly based on state road tax slabs. Some states charge higher lifetime road tax for luxury cars.

🧾 2. Breakdown of Typical Costs

When buying a luxury imported car like the M8 Competition in India, the price is not just the invoice price — here’s what adds up:

💰 Price Components

Ex-Showroom Price – Base price of the car before any add-ons

GST – Goods & Services Tax levied on the car

TCS (Tax Collected at Source) – 1% on cars above ₹10 L

RTO/Registration Charges – Vary state to state

Insurance – Comprehensive car insurance

Handling & Logistic Fees – Dealer handling charges, often included

👉 These combine to form the On-Road Price seen above.

🛣️ 3. Road Tax & Registration Tips (India)

Road tax differs widely by state — sometimes 15%–30% of ex-showroom price.

Some buyers consider registering in low-tax UTs (like Puducherry) to reduce initial tax costs — though this is subject to legal residency rules and long-term validation. Authorities can crack down if car use and registration don’t match residency.

⚠️ Be careful: registering in a low-tax region while living elsewhere can lead to scrutiny or fines.

🧠 4. How to Buy: Step-by-Step (India)

Here’s a practical path:

✅ Step 1 — Research & Budgeting

Verify your overall budget — include loan interest if financing

Plan for higher maintenance & fuel costs for a performance V8 car

✅ Step 2 — Visit a BMW Showroom

Find AMG/M BMW authorized dealers in major cities

Talk about availability (often limited stock)

Ask for a detailed price breakup (ex-showroom → on-road)

✅ Step 3 — Negotiate Financials

Banks offer auto loans / EMIs

Typical down-payment ~30–40% helps reduce EMI

Check if there are any corporate discounts / seasonal offers

✅ Step 4 — Documentation

You’ll need:

Proof of identity & address

PAN card

Financial documents if taking a loan

Insurance documents

✅ Step 5 — Registration & Insurance

Dealer will handle RTO registration

Choose comprehensive insurance — usually ~₹3 – ₹10 L for luxury cars

🛠️ 5. Running & Ownership Costs

Owning an M8 Competition is not just purchase price:

🔧 Maintenance & Service

Servicing a high-performance car is expensive compared to mass-market cars

Certified BMW service centers have premium cost parts & labor

⛽ Fuel & Tyres

Large V8 engine → high fuel cost

Performance tyres → expensive replacements

General estimate: running cost ~₹10-₹12 per km based on fuel price.

📅 6. Best Time to Buy in India

While not specific to BMW M8, buyers often benefit from:

End of financial year deals (March quarter)

Year-end or festive discounts

New model release periods when dealers clear stock

Negotiation leverage often increases when dealership targets are close to deadlines.

🛍️ 7. Alternative Ways to Buy
⚡ 1. Pre-Owned Market

CPO (Certified Pre-Owned) BMW cars can be cheaper

Always check service records

🚢 2. Import Yourself

Can you import from abroad?

Yes, but import duties + compliance costs often exceed dealership pricing

You’d still need to pay customs + GST
